            MAY 2021 – DATE</h3>
        <p>
            In this role, I function as a data analyst and manager. I collaborated with
            team members to enhance the overall process across major aspects of
            the unit. I introduced an automated email system for managing
            reconciliation requests, designed and deployed a relational database
            along with supporting scripts to optimize the premium allocation process

            making it less manual and error prone than it used to be, made structural
            adjustments within the direct debit team so tasks are effectively
            distributed and handled, designed a database to manage direct debit
            records and automate the process of generating accounts that are due
            for debit each day, developed a data warehouse containing more than
            40 million records and automation scripts to discover reconciliation issues
            before they become obvious, introduced a dedicated reconciliation
            channel for claims requests, designed interactive performance
            dashboards and reports using Power BI, built several custom Excel
            templates to standardize data collection and submission. Consequently,
            claims related reconciliation requests are resolved almost immediately,
            direct debit mandates are setup faster, allocation is completed faster
            also, and we can track our work. Additionally, I have transferred
            knowledge to at least 40 employees across various units through
            organized trainings to help boost their efficiency.
